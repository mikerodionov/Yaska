## Mientras with the present indicative or the present subjunctive

The word "mientras" in Spanish introduces a subordinate clause that expresses an action that is taking place at the same time as another (while) or a condition that is needed to fulfil the action in the main clause (as long as).

Mientras with the present indicative = while / parallel action

Mientras tú ves la televisión yo friego los platos.

Mientras with the present subjunctive = as long as / condition

Acepto tu oferta mientras me pagues lo que prometes.

We can also use "siempre que..." or "mientras que..."with the same meaning as "mientras" (as long as).
