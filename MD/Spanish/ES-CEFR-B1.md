## Mientras with the present indicative or the present subjunctive

The word "mientras" in Spanish introduces a subordinate clause that expresses an action that is taking place at the same time as another (while) or a condition that is needed to fulfil the action in the main clause (as long as).

Mientras with the present indicative = while / parallel action

Mientras tú ves la televisión yo friego los platos.

Mientras with the present subjunctive = as long as / condition

Acepto tu oferta mientras me pagues lo que prometes.

We can also use "siempre que..." or "mientras que..."with the same meaning as "mientras" (as long as).

```
mientras + El Presente = while
mientras + El Presente de Subjuntivo = as long as / only if
```

Sometimes, in sentences using the future tense in the main clause, mientras could also mean while when followed by the subjunctive. In this case, we will be talking about two actions that may happen at the same time. For example:

"Irina bailará mientras nosotros cantemos."

The meaning of this sentence could be:

1. Irina will dance as long as we sing. (only if we sing she will dance)

2. Irina will dance while we sing. (for as long as/while we sing she will dance -two possible actions happening at the same time)
